""" The physics module contains a set of objects used throught the system to
	calculate different information. One example is the polar and cartesian
	libraries. They let you seemlesly convert between the two coordinate types
	and do addition, subtraction, multiplication and devision. These are used
	by features like the drive (in order to keep track of its location) and to
	generate grids to be displayed within maps. Another use to to calculate the
	location of sensor hits.
